React Hooks 

useState Hook --> 
1.the useState hook lets u add state to the functional components.
2.in classes state is always and object 
3.with the useState hook the state doesn't have to be the object
4.THe useState hook returns an array with two elements
5.the first element is the current value of the state and the second element is the state setter
6.In case if your new state value depends on the previous value you can pass the funtion in the setter with previous state as an argument
7.when state value is an object or an array always spread the value of the state we don't want to change and then change the desired state value.

for example ==> 
const [name , setName ] = useState({firstName:'',lastName:''});

const clickHandler = ( ) => {
    setName((prevState)=> { ...prevState,name.firstName = 'updated name'})
}
